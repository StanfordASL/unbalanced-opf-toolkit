# Unbalanced OPF Toolkit (UOT)
A general code base to formulate and solve unbalanced optimal power flow (OPF) problems written in *MATLAB*. 
UOT formulates the optimization problems using [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io) allowing to use a multitude of solvers. 
UOT supports [GridLAB-D](https://www.gridlabd.org/) models of the power distribution network.

## Documentation
The project's documentation is hosted in [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

## Contributing
